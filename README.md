# metacritic_scraper ðŸ“ˆ

I scraped this data intending to answer the following questions for PC games:

* **Do metacritic scores correlate with sales?**
    * Should a videogame publisher/developer pay attention to critic reviews?
   
* **Which critic's scores correlate best with sales?**
    *  Specifically, which critics should a videogame publisher/developer pay attention to?
