# metacritic_scraper 

I scraped critic scores from Metacritic to answer the following questions:

* **Do metacritic scores correlate with sales?**
    * Should a videogame publisher/developer pay attention to critic reviews?
   
* **Which critic's scores correlate best with sales?**
    *  Specifically, which critics should a videogame publisher/developer pay attention to?

   [Metacritic_Steam_2021.csv](scraper/Metacritic_Steam_2021.csv)
## [üìàAnalysis.ipynb (Python and R)](analysis/analysis.ipynb)
   [Analyzed.csv](analysis/analyzed.csv)

## Findings:
These critics scores ([analyzed.csv](analysis/analyzed.csv)) are positively and significantly correlated with the total number of Steam reviews the game received, our proxy for sales. The data seems to indicate that these critics know what makes a game sell (except *Game Revolution*, which is sigificantly negatively correlatated, do the opposite of what they say).
